Hello world! (How original, innit?)

This is my blog, of ideas and projects I have been working on, be it software, electronics, 3D printing, or DIY. 

Some of my writing might be incorrect, either technically or politically, pure rambling, or might not make sense.
We are all [human, after all](https://youtube.com/?s=human+after+all+daft+punk+todo+fix+link), and the scope of this exercise is for both sides of this page to learn and connect.

Thanks for checking out my little place on the internet, and I hope you'll enjoy the content! - Calin
