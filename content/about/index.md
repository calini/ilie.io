Hello world! (How original, innit?)

This is my blog, where I will be writing about  ideas and projects I have been working on within software, electronics, 3D printing, DIY and more. 

Some of my writing might be incorrect, either technically or politically, pure rambling, or might not make sense.
We are all [human, after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk), and the goal of this exercise is for both reader and writer to connect and improve.

Thanks for checking out my little place on the internet, and I hope you'll enjoy the content! - Calin
