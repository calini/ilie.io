Hello world! 

This is my blog, where I will be writing about ideas and projects I have been working on, in my areas of interest: software, security, electronics, 3D printing, DIY and much more. 

Thanks for checking out my little place on the internet, and I hope you'll enjoy the content! - CÄƒlin

Disclaimer: Some of my writing might be incorrect, either technically or politically, or might not even make sense. We are [human after all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk), and the goal of this exercise is for both reader and writer to connect and improve. Constructive feedback is really appreciated!
