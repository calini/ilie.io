Hey, this pandemic kinda hit different, didn't it?
Well, I hope that's all behind us, and we grew more resilient. We'll need it for harsher times ahead.

For me, this blog is a challenge I set for myself to open up to the world through writing, showcase some of my ideas, and hopefully become a better person as a result. Only time will tell.

In the meanwhile, stay tuned!
