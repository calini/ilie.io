Hey, the pandemic kinda hit different, didn't it?
Well, I hope that's all behind us, or at least we grew stronger and got better at dealing with the possibly harsher times ahead.

For me, this blog is a new challenge I set for myself, to communicate with the world through writing, showcase my ideas, and hopefully become a better person as a result. Only time will tell.

In the meanwhile, stay tuned!
