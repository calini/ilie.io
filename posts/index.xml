&lt;p>This is my blog, where I will be writing about ideas and projects I have been working on, in my areas of interest: software, security, electronics, 3D printing, DIY and much more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for checking out my little place on the internet, and I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy the content! - CÄƒlin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disclaimer: Some of my writing might be incorrect, either technically or politically, or might not even make sense. We are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXYeARRyDWk">human after all&lt;/a>, and the goal of this exercise is for both reader and writer to connect and improve. Constructive feedback is really appreciated!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
